# BMAP

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ZY-Ang/bmap/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ZY-Ang/bmap/tree/master)

This is a monorepo so we shall organize the front and backend in subdirectories. You can install dependencies for one project without installing them for another with this project structure.

See README.md within ~/crawler or ~/webapp for separate setup instructions.

It is not a requirement to setup CircleCI for this project so if you would like to do so, please visit the documentation yourself.
